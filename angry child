/*Bill Gates is on one of his philanthropic journeys to a village in Utopia. He has brought a box of packets of candies and would like to distribute one 
packet to each of the children. Each of the packets contains a number of candies. He wants to minimize the
cumulative difference in the number of candies in the packets he hands out. This is called the unfairness sum. Determine the minimum unfairness sum achievable.*/
